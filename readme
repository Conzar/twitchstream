Ok so the following an explanation of how these scripts work. All information I've gathered mostly from
https://libav.org/avconv.html and http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/en/man1/avconv.1.html so 
please use both sources as often as possible when trying to set these up for your system. 

My script will allow you to run a camera and two logos as overlays on  your game. It will also stream and sync your microphone and your desktop sounds quite perfectly. 

Installations you're going to need:
pavucontrol 
libav
pulseaudio

/*** This script was written in Ubuntu 14.04 with pulseaudio. If you're only running alsa you're going to have to change the -f pulse -i "Virtual1.monitor" \ to correspond with your alsa installation. If you have no idea try replacing that line with: 

-f alsa -ac 2 -i pulse \
***/

Create a file for your twitchkey which can be obtained by logging in as you and visiting this link: 
http://www.twitch.tv/<YOUR_USERNAME>/dashboard/streamkey

Please remember to switch <YOUR_USERNAME> with your username. Paste your twitch key into your favorite text editor, and save it as .twitch_key. 

Now run the audioload script which will loop your desktop and mic into one output. 

Now run the twitchstream script, and follow the instructions that are in the that script for setting it up the rest of the way. Good Luck, and Good Streaming. 


Troubleshooting:
The -f x11grab line is written, to screen capture 1920x1080 (INRES) starting at position 0.0, however 
because I have dual monitors (top is 1360x768 and bottom is 1920x1080) I had to move 0.0 down 768 pixels. 

If you're only running one monitor, then you can remove the +0,768 from the x11grab line. 

The overlay, is written for a 1920x1080 screen, you'll need to move those around as well.
